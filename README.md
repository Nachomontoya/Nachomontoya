Graduated in advertising and public relationships in 2008, I'm a master's in Art Direction from Miami Ad School Madrid in 2012 with a 3 months internship at Miami Ad School Europe (Hamburg)

I've worked as Art Director at agencies worldwide such as Ogilvy Paris, Leo Burnett Iberia and Pingüino & Torreblanca among others and worked creating national and international campaigns for brands such as Coca-Cola, Grey Goose, Perrier, Fiat, Orange, etc.

In 2016 I quit working full time at agencies to become a freelancer Art Director and Graphic Designer. Since then, my job has been focused on editorials, web design and branding for companies that believe in creativity and are aware of the importance of teamwork and people to find a real purpose that makes their own difference.

In March 2021 I decided to take a big turn in my career and become a Full Stack Developer with a focus in the back-end. I majored in Full Stack Software Engineering at [Assembler School of Software Engineering](https://www.assemblerschool.com/). Today I feel very proud to say that I become a Full Stack developer with a focus on MERN Stack (M stands for both MongoDB and MySQL) and a background as a creative director and graphic designer. Constantly looking forward to using and learning new technologies, I'm passionate about making the user the center of the product.
